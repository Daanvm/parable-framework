# Parable PHP Framework

## 2.0.3

_Changes_
- Fixed `ServerCommand`
- Code cleanup

## 2.0.2

_Changes_
- It's been in alpha so long I forgot `Application::VERSION` existed! BOOM. 2.0.2!

## 2.0.1

_Changes_
- Rename name in composer.json for proper Packagist placing.

## 2.0.0

It's time! Finally a 2.0.0 release, locking the interface in place for at least a while.

This means [devvoh/parable](https://github.com/devvoh/parable) is now officially abandoned.

_Changes_
- Updated all packages to their newly released 1.0.0 versions.
- Feel pretty good about the above.
